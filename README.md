   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Generate app key:**

   php artisan key:generate
   ```

5. **Configure database** in `.env` file:

   ```env
   DB_DATABASE=your_database
   DB_USERNAME=your_username
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```

6. **Run migrations:**

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

7. **Start the Laravel server:**

## âœ… Troubleshooting

* If `composer install` fails, make sure **PHP & Composer** are installed and available in PATH.
* If `npm install` fails, try deleting `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then run `npm install` again.
* For database issues, confirm MySQL is running and credentials in `.env` are correct.
